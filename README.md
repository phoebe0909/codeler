# Welcome to Codeler! 

  I created this game as a tribute to the popular word-guessing game, Wordle, but with coding as the theme of the game. My goal was to put my new Android Studio skills to use on a project of my own. As I learn more about working with Android, I continue to revisit this project and add new features.

  The Codeler app opens to a simple home page which describes the rules of the game: Guess the word in 6 or fewer tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to tell you which letters you guessed right. The home page is a bit simple, but Iâ€™m focused on learning to write code rather than finessing the design.

  The main activity implements the game itself: 6 rows of tiles that light up with different colors as the user makes their guesses.

## Some of the new techniques that I learned from this project: 
Reading from CSV files; creating onClickListeners, alert dialogs and vibration patterns; and working with shared preferences. 

## Upcoming goals for the project:   
Creating a more responsive design. Adding social media features. Adding animations to the color tiles.

## Skip ahead to the good stuff:
